        <h3>     <p>
            We started The Book Cafe with a vision to build a community which connects over books and coffee for mutual growth. It's where passion goes and the happiness flows." That's what makes us happy as the founding team. It's just about our passion and how we want to deliver our best ideas to our customers whether it is about the coffee, the food we make or how we connect people through events and community-building activities. Every cup has a budding story. We feel delighted when people come and tell us their success stories which started with their happy place-The Book Cafe.
             We hope that this site has provided you all with  what you  all were searching and it  is my immense pleasure to thank all the designers that made this site into what it  is right now. THANK YOU
